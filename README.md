In this project, Apache Spark is used to develop a "spam/ham" keywords identifier to be used in an email classification algorithm. This task was achieved by using natural language processing techniques and the mutual information measurement. Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing, as we can see on their website (​ http://spark.apache.org/​ ).

Natural Language processing is a multi-disciplinary field related to computer science and artificial intelligence. It is used in many application such as machine translation, information extraction, summarization or question answering.

The given Ling-Spam email dataset contains two directories, “spam” and “ham”, containing the spam and legitimate emails, respectively. Natural Language processing is applied to develop an algorithm that will obtain the keywords from the given emails to classify them.
